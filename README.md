At the beginning of this project, I started by building empty HTML files. Then, I started adding the necessary tags for HTML. After that, the content has been added along with the appropriate tags. Meanwhile, CSS being created for formatting the pages. Later, JavaScript codes have been integrated with the pages to enhance those pages. In this assignment, I have learned that HTML5 is more advanced than the previous versions of HTML. Also, I explored uploading on the Pitt website. It was a hands-on experience in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The project took me around approximately 15 hours, including Pitt webserver upload. In the assignment file, you will find HTML pages in the main directory, a CSS file on a directory called CSS. For images, it is stored in Images directory.  
Overall, working in this assignment was enjoyable and an opportunity to learn how to design web pages ending with uploading them to the web server. For future students, I suggest that the assignment remains as it is because I believe it is beneficial.
